To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a `Solver`, a contract that responds to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` with the right number.

Easy right?
Well... there's a catch.

The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. 
That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

Good luck!
