This level will ask you to break `DexTwo`, a subtlely modified `Dex` contract from the previous level, in a different way.

You need to drain all balances of token1 and token2 from the `DexTwo` contract to succeed in this level.

You will still start with 10 tokens of `token1` and 10 of `token2`. The DEX contract still starts with 100 of each token. 

&nbsp;
Things that might help:
* How has the `swap` method been modified?
* Could you use a custom token contract in your attack?
