While this example may be simple, confusing `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` can lead to phishing-style attacks, such as [this](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks/). 

An example of a possible attack is outlined below.

1) Use `tx.origin` to determine whose tokens to transfer, e.g.

```
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) {
  tokens[tx.origin] -= _value;
  tokens[_to] += _value;
}
```
2) Attacker gets victim to send funds to a malicious contract that calls the transfer function of the token contract, e.g. 

```
function () payable {
  token.transfer(attackerAddress, 10000);
}
```

3) In this scenario, `tx.origin` will be the victim's address (while `msg.sender` will be the malicious contract's address), resulting in the funds being transferred from the victim to the attacker.
