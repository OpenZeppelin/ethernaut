The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start with 10 tokens of `token1` and 10 of `token2`. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token. 

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets. 

&nbsp;
### Quick note
Normally, when you make a swap with an ERC20 token, you have to `approve` the contract to spend your tokens for you. To keep with the syntax of the game, we've just added the `approve` method to the contract itself. So feel free to use `contract.approve(contract.address, <uint amount>)` instead of calling the tokens directly, and it will automatically approve spending the two tokens by the desired amount. Feel free to ignore the `SwappableToken` contract otherwise.

Things that might help:
* How is the price of the token calculated?
* How does the `swap` method work?
* How do you `approve` a transaction of an ERC20?
