  "usingConsole": "Most game interaction is via the browser's console: `Dev Tools -> Console`. Open the console and enter the command: \n\n`help()`\n\n to see a list of objects and functions injected by the game to the console. Since most interactions are asynchronous, we recommend using Chrome v62 which enables the `async`/`await` keywords in the console, so instead of writting:\n\n`getBalance(player)> PROMISE`\n\nand opening the promise. With await/async, you can write:\n\n`await getBalance(player) > '1.11002387' `\n\n",
  "gameMechanics": "The game uses the main contract `Ethernaut.sol` to manage player progress and delegate interaction with `Level.sol` implementations. Each level contract emits instances for players to manipulate, break, destroy, fix, etc. The player requests an instance, manipulates it and returns it to the game for evaluation of level completion.\n\n Both requesting instances and submitting instances back to the game are done with the buttons in the user interface in each level. When this app retrieves an instance from `Ethernaut.sol`, it wraps it in a `TruffleContract` object and exposes it in the browser's console. See the first level for a full tutorial on how to play the game.",
  "beyondConsole": "Some levels will require working outside of the browser console. That is, writing solidity code and deploying it in the network to attack the level's instance contract with another contract. This can be done in multiple ways, for example: \n\n1) Use Remix to write the code and deploy it in the corresponding network See [Remix Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).\n\n 2) Setup a local truffle project to develop and deploy the attack contracts. See [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).",
  "troubleshooting": "Sometimes \n\n(a) the app state or (b) the MetaMask plugin state \n\ncan become a bit messed up, specially after switching networks, unlocking, etc. If what you're seeing doesn't make much sense, try refreshing the app, hard-refreshing it, disabling and re-enabling your metamask plugin or even restarting your browser. \n\nIf you find issues, please let us know at ethernaut@zeppelin.solutions",
  "poweredBy": "powered by ",
  "setupMetamask": "If you don't have it already, install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/) (in Chrome, Firefox, Brave or Opera on your desktop machine). \n\nSet up the extension's wallet and use the network selector to point to the preferred network in the top left of the extension's interface. Alternatively you can use the UI button to switch between networks. If you select an unsupported network, the game will notify you and bring you to the default Goerli testnet.  \n\nOnce done, come back here and reload the webpage"
