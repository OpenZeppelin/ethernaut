Next time, those friends will request an audit before depositing any money on a contract. Congrats!

Frequently, using proxy contracts is highly recommended to bring upgradeability features and reduce the deployment's gas cost. However, developers must be careful not to introduce storage collisions, as seen in this level.

Furthermore, iterating over operations that consume ETH can lead to issues if it is not handled correctly. Even if ETH is spent, `msg.value` will remain the same, so the developer must manually keep track of the actual remaining amount on each iteration. This can also lead to issues when using a multi-call pattern, as performing multiple `delegatecall`s to a function that looks safe on its own could lead to unwanted transfers of ETH, as `delegatecall`s keep the original `msg.value` sent to the contract.

Move on to the next level when you're ready!
