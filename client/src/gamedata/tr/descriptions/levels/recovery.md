A contract creator has built a very simple token factory contract. Anyone can create new tokens with ease. After deploying the first token contract, the creator sent `0.5` ether to obtain more tokens. They have since lost the contract address. 

This level will be completed if you can recover (or remove) the `0.5` ether from the lost contract address.
