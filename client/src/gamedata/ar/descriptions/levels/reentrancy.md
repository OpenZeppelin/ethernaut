The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.

&nbsp;
Things that might help:
* Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.
* Fallback methods
* Throw/revert bubbling
* Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
* See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"
