This level features a `CryptoVault` with special functionality, the `sweepToken` function. This is a common function used to retrieve tokens stuck in a contract. The `CryptoVault` operates with an `underlying` token that can't be swept, as it is an important core logic component of the `CryptoVault`. Any other tokens can be swept.

The underlying token is an instance of the DET token implemented in the `DoubleEntryPoint` contract definition and the `CryptoVault` holds 100 units of it. Additionally the `CryptoVault` also holds 100 of `LegacyToken LGT`.

In this level you should figure out where the bug is in `CryptoVault` and protect it from being drained out of tokens.

The contract features a `Forta` contract where any user can register its own `detection bot` contract. Forta is a decentralized, community-based monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems as quickly as possible. Your job is to implement a `detection bot` and register it in the `Forta` contract. The bot's implementation will need to raise correct alerts to prevent potential attacks or bug exploits.
