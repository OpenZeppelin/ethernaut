Congratulations! You've successfully unlocked another secret of the elliptic curve signatures!

It is very important to never reuse the same nonce for two signatures. [RFC6979](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979) defines a deterministic digital signature generation procedure which removes the risks of reusing twice the same nonce.
