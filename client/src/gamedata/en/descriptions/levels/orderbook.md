A new venue for trading tokens launched in the middle of the last bear market. It promised to keep things simple and low cost by removing complexity for users. To accomplish this, the platform implemented a very simple order book which executes matching trades using an exact-match algorithm. The platform only ever supported three whitelisted tokens. A novel feature at the time, it allowed users to make fee-less trades by submitting signed orders to its front end, where the company would then pay for the transactions. Sadly, however, high gas prices have led the company to stop paying for user trades and the front end behind the platform has been shut down.

The venue was mildly successful among a small group of users, and a handful of trades were successfully executed on the platform. In fact, a few of the old trades are still outstanding, but have never been filled. (Since they have yet to be filled, they are likely unfavorable trades.)

Looking through the event logs for old trades shows that much more favorable trades were made in the past. Using what you have learned from the Malleability challenge, try to do much better than you could if you were just filling the currently unfilled trades. Keep in mind, this may require forcing participants to trade against each other.

Can you get 100 units of the last token that was whitelisted on the platform?
