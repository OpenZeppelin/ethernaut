The TimeVault contract below implements a secure storage with a time lock mechanism. The vault is designed to remain locked for a specific time period (1 hour) before anyone can access its contents.

The vault contains a secret value that must be set to a specific number to complete this level.

Your goal is to bypass the time lock and set the secret value to 42.

Time is an illusion in the blockchain world. Can you manipulate it to your advantage?
