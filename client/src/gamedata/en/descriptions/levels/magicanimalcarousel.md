Welcome, dear Anon, to the Magic Carousel, where creatures spin and twirl in a boundless spell. In this magical, infinite digital wheel, they loop and whirl with enchanting zeal.

Add a creature to join the fun, but heed the rule, or the gameâ€™s undone.
If an animal joins the ride, take care when you check again, that same animal must be there!

Can you break the magic rule of the carousel?
