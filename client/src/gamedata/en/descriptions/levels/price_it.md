Bob wanted to create his decentralized exchange where users can swap token0s & token1s with ease. He was too lazy to learn about Chainlink, so he decided to query the token0/token1 pair to calculate swaps prices.
Make your token0 balance greater than 9,000 to win this level.

##### Things that might help:
* Flash swaps.
* Understand how Uniswap pair works.
* For your comfort, we created a token0/token2 pair, loaded with 100,000 of each token. Good luck!
