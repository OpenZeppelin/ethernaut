This level demonstrates the vulnerability of using `block.timestamp` for time-based access controls in smart contracts.

The solution involves understanding that miners have some control over block timestamps. While they cannot set arbitrary timestamps, they can manipulate them within certain bounds (typically Â±15 seconds from the actual time).

In testing environments like Foundry or Hardhat, you can use time manipulation functions (`vm.warp()` or `evm_increaseTime()`) to fast-forward time and bypass the timelock immediately.

For secure timelock implementations, consider:
- Using block numbers instead of timestamps for more predictable timing
- Implementing additional access controls beyond time-based restrictions
- Using established timelock patterns like OpenZeppelin's TimelockController
- Being aware that all on-chain data is public, including "private" variables
