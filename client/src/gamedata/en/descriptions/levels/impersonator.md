SlockDotItâ€™s new product, **ECLocker**, integrates IoT gate locks with Solidity smart contracts, utilizing Ethereum ECDSA for authorization. When a valid signature is sent to the lock, the system emits an `Open` event, unlocking doors for the authorized controller. SlockDotIt has hired you to assess the security of this product before its launch. Can you compromise the system in a way that anyone can open the door?
