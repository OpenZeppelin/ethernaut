This is the Forger, the token printer your mom warned you about.

This ERC20 hands out mint passes signed by the owner... or so they say.

One golden signature already exists, good for 100 shiny tokens.

The team insists the pass is single-use and perfectly safe.

Your goal? Making the total supply greater than 100 tokens.

Get creative, stay sharp, and may your forgeries be legendary.
