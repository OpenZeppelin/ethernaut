Congratulations! We all wish we could accept old trades!

Making other users trade with each other is pretty clever too. Remember that signatures don't guarantee uniqueness.

And if your funds are with services that don't understand security - it's time to get out. Fortunately, you withdrew your funds so nobody can run this attack against you!
