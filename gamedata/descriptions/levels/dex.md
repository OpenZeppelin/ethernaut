The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic [DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange) contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

You will start 10 tokens of `tkn1` and 10 of `tkn2`. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token. 

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract. 

&nbsp;
Things that might help:
* How is the price of the token calculated?
* How does the `swap` method work?
