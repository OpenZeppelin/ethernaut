The integer math portion aside, getting prices or any sort of data from any single source is a massive attack vector in smart contracts. 

You can clearly see from this example, that someone with a lot of capital could manipulate the price in one fell swoop, and cause any applications relying on it to use the the wrong price.

The exchange itself is decentralized, but the price of the asset is centralized, since it comes from 1 dex. This is why we need [oracles](https://betterprogramming.pub/what-is-a-blockchain-oracle-f5ccab8dbd72?source=friends_link&sk=d921a38466df8a9176ed8dd767d8c77d). Oracles are ways to get data into and out of smart contracts. We should be getting our data from multiple independent decentralized sources. 

[Chainlink Data Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price) are a secure, reliable, way to get decentralized data into your smart contracts. 

```

pragma solidity ^0.6.7;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract PriceConsumerV3 {

    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Kovan
     * Aggregator: ETH/USD
     * Address: 0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331
     */
    constructor() public {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price
     */
    function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (
            uint80 roundID, 
            int price,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return price;
    }
}
