In order to prevent re-entrancy attacks when moving funds out of your contract, use the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern) being aware that `call` will only return false without interrupting the execution flow. Solutions such as [ReentrancyGuard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#ReentrancyGuard) or [PullPayment](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/payment#PullPayment) can also be used.

`transfer` and `send` are no longer recommended solutions as they can potentially break contracts after the Istanbul hard fork [Source 1](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/) [Source 2](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/reentrancy-after-istanbul/1742).

Always assume that the receiver of the funds you are sending can be another contract, not just a regular address. Hence, it can execute code in its payable fallback method and *re-enter* your contract, possibly messing up your state/logic.

Re-entrancy is a common attack. You should always be prepared for it!

#### The DAO Hack

The famous DAO hack used reentrancy to extract a huge amount of ether from the victim contract. See [15 lines of code that could have prevented TheDAO Hack](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/15-lines-of-code-that-could-have-prevented-thedao-hack-782499e00942).
