Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint8)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"custom:oz-retyped-from\":\"bool\",\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"shanghai\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":1000},\"remappings\":[\":ds-test/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\",\":erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-06/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-06/contracts/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-08/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-08/contracts/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/\",\":openzeppelin-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/\",\":openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/\"]},\"sources\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x89be10e757d242e9b18d5a32c9fbe2019f6d63052bbe46397a430a1d60d7f794\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f103ee2e4aecd37aac6ceefe670709cdd7613dee25fa2d4d9feaf7fc0aaa155e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRiNZLoJk5k3HPMYGPGjZFd2ke1ZxjhJZkM45Ec9GH9hv\"]},\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x9c80f545915582e63fe206c6ce27cbe85a86fc10b9cd2a0e8c9488fb7c2ee422\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://310136ad60820af4177a11a61d77a3686faf5fca4942b600e08fc940db38396b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbCzMNSTL7Zi7M4UCSqBrkHtp4jjxUnGbkneCZKdR1qeq\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.25+commit.b61c2a91"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"version","type":"uint8","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["ds-test/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","erc4626-tests/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","openzeppelin-contracts-06/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-06/contracts/","openzeppelin-contracts-08/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-08/contracts/","openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","openzeppelin-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/","openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":1000},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"shanghai","libraries":{}},"sources":{"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x89be10e757d242e9b18d5a32c9fbe2019f6d63052bbe46397a430a1d60d7f794","urls":["bzz-raw://f103ee2e4aecd37aac6ceefe670709cdd7613dee25fa2d4d9feaf7fc0aaa155e","dweb:/ipfs/QmRiNZLoJk5k3HPMYGPGjZFd2ke1ZxjhJZkM45Ec9GH9hv"],"license":"MIT"},"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x9c80f545915582e63fe206c6ce27cbe85a86fc10b9cd2a0e8c9488fb7c2ee422","urls":["bzz-raw://310136ad60820af4177a11a61d77a3686faf5fca4942b600e08fc940db38396b","dweb:/ipfs/QmbCzMNSTL7Zi7M4UCSqBrkHtp4jjxUnGbkneCZKdR1qeq"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":33}
